1) Has hitting for avg gone down?
    -Recently, it seems that every big leaguer is swinging for the fences. As a whole, homeruns seem to be up across the league but batting average seems to be down as strikeouts
     and flyouts appear to be more acceptable. It would be interesting to compare batting averages, homeruns, and, and strikeouts to see if there was a point that indicates a 
     change in baseball culture

2) Kyle Schwarber: low batting average but high OPS
    -Schwarbs' batting average is league average at best, however, his OPS (on base percentage (OBP) + slugging pct) is higher than expected. I would like to compare his 
     strikeout rate, batting avg, OPS, and OBP (maybe slugging too) compared to the league averages to see where he ranks/if he is doing something significant

3) Pitching
    -I want to look at the most common pitches thrown.
        -Breakdown by pitch type, strikeout rate, homerun pitch, etc.
